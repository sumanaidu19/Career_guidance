          <p>Engineering is the designing, testing and building of machines, structures and processes using maths and science. Studying it can lead to a rewarding career. Engineering is a discipline dedicated to problem solving.
            While scientists and inventors come up with innovations, it is engineers who apply these discoveries to the real world.

             <div class="item"><p>Computer hardware engineers create computer systems and their components, including processors, hard drives, networks and circuit boards. They work on every aspect of hardware creation, including research, design, development, testing and production.
            Hardware and software engineering are two important information technology (IT) fields that involve working with computers. Hardware engineering focuses on computer hardware components, while software engineering focuses on programs and applications.
            Hardware is more capital-intensive than software. Hardware takes more time to build and deploy at scale than software. Hardware usually has slimmer margins than software.

        <p>Engineering is a diverse field with numerous branches including civil, mechanical, electrical, and software engineering. Understanding the specific area you want to specialize in is crucial as it will shape your educational and career path.
          Embarking on a career in engineering can be both exciting and challenging. This guide is designed to provide you with the essential tools and insights to kickstart your journey. 
          Internships, apprenticeships, and project-based learning provide hands-on experience that is invaluable in the engineering field. Real-world experience not only enhances your resume but also helps you apply theoretical knowledge in practical situations.
          Technical proficiency is vital, but so are soft skills such as problem-solving, teamwork, and communication. Engineers often work in multidisciplinary teams and must convey complex ideas clearly and effectively.
